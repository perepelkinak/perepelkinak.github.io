<h1>War and Peace</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<div id="text">
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.
    But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and
    horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist - I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have nothing more
    to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself!
    But how do you do? I see I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news.</span>"
    <p/>
    It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna Scherer</span>,
    maid of honor and favorite of the <span class="blue">Empress Marya Fedorovna</span>. With these words
    she greeted <span class="blue">Prince Vasili Kuragin</span>, a man of high rank and importance, who
    was the first to arrive at her reception. <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span> had had a cough for
    some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in
    <span class="blue">St. Petersburg</span>, used only by the elite.
    <p/>
    All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried
    footman that morning, ran as follows:
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of
    spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you
    tonight between 7 and 10 - Annette Scherer.</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">Heavens! what a virulent attack!</span>" replied <span class="blue">the prince</span>,
    not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform,
    knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke
    in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing
    intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to
    <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span>, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and
    shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind at rest,</span>"
    said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even
    irony could be discerned.
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has
    any feeling?</span>" said <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span>. "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">You are staying the
    whole evening, I hope?</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an
    appearance there,</span>" said <span class="blue">the prince</span>. "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">My daughter is
    coming for me to take me there.</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks
    are becoming wearisome.</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,</span>"
    said <span class="blue">the prince</span>, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did
    not even wish to be believed.
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's dispatch? You know
    everything.</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">What can one say about it?</span>" replied <span class="blue">the prince</span> in a cold,
    listless tone. "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his
    boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.</span>"
    <p/>
    <span class="blue">Prince Vasili</span> always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part.
    <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span> Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed
    with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes
    even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations
    of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played
    round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which
    she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.
    <p/>
    In the midst of a conversation on political matters <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span> burst out:
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand things, but Austria
    never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our
    gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have
    faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so
    virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra
    of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain!
    We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with
    her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She
    has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions.
    What answer did Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the
    self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind.
    And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia
    has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And
    I don't believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just
    a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!</span>"
    <p/>
    She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">I think,</span>" said <span class="blue">the prince</span> with a smile,
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">that if you had been sent instead of our dear
    <span class="blue" title="It's a name">Wintzingerode</span>
    you would have captured the
    <span class="blue" title="It's a name">King of Prussia</span>'s
    consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">In a moment. A propos,</span>" she added, becoming calm again, "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">I am
    expecting two very interesting men tonight,
    <span class="blue" title="It's a name">le Vicomte de Mortemart</span>, who is
    connected with the <span class="blue" title="It's a name">Montmorencys</span>
    through the <span class="blue" title="It's a name">Rohans</span>, one of the
    best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And also the
    <span class="blue" title="It's a name">Abbe Morio</span>.
    Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by
    <span class="blue" title="It's a name">the Emperor</span>. Had you heard?</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">I shall be delighted to meet them,</span>" said <span class="blue">the prince</span>.
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">But tell me,</span>" he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred
    to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">is it
    true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all
    accounts is a poor creature.</span>"
    <p/>
    <span class="blue">Prince Vasili</span> wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying
    through the <span class="blue">Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna</span> to secure it for
    <span class="blue">the baron</span>.
    <p/>
    <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span> almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else
    had a right to criticize what <span class="blue">the Empress</span> desired or was pleased with.
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,</span>"
    was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.
    <p/>
    As she named <span class="blue">the Empress</span>, <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna's</span> face suddenly
    assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred
    every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that <span class="blue">Her Majesty</span>
    had deigned to show <span class="blue">Baron Funke</span>, and again her face clouded over with sadness.
    <p/>
    <span class="blue">The prince</span> was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and
    courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span> wished both
    to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to <span class="blue">the Empress</span>)
    and at the same time to console him, so she said:
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been
    enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.</span>"
    <p/>
    <span class="blue">The prince</span> bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">I often think,</span>" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince
    and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come
    for intimate conversation- "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are
    distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don't speak of
    <span class="blue" title="It's a name">Anatole</span>,
    your youngest. I don't like him,</span>" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her
    eyebrows. "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone,
    and so you don't deserve to have them.</span>"
    <p/>
    And she smiled her ecstatic smile.
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">I can't help it,</span>" said <span class="blue">the prince</span>.
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.</span>"
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with
    your younger son? Between ourselves</span>" (and her face assumed its melancholy expression),
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">he was mentioned at Her Majesty's and you were pitied....</span>"
    <p/>
    <span class="blue">The prince</span> answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,
    awaiting a reply. He frowned.
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">What would you have me do?</span>" he said at last. "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">You know
    I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least
    a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.</span>" He said this
    smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly
    revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.
    <p/>
    "<span class="red" title="Anna Pavlovna's speech">And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be
    nothing I could reproach you with,</span>" said <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span>, looking up pensively.
    <p/>
    "<span class="green" title="The prince's speech">I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane
    of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!</span>"
    <p/>
    He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a  gesture.
    <span class="blue">Anna Pavlovna</span> meditated.
